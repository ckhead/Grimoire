# Grimoire
A grimoire is "a book of magic spells and invocations."

I have a bunch of Google Docs where I put code that I use infrequently and tend to forget. 
So now my plan is to convert these files to Markdown and gradually move them up to Grimoire.
- Shell commands including git
- LaTeX packages and tricks
- R (mainly data.table)
- Julia
  
So far I only have done this for the shortest file, Shell commands.
