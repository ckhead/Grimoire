# Grimoire
I have a bunch of Google Docs where I put code that I use rarely enough that I tend to forget it. 
So now my plan is to convert these files to Markdown and gradually move them up to Grimoire.
- Shell commands including git
- LaTeX packages and tricks
- R (mainly data.table)
- Julia
So far I only have done this for the shortest file, Shell commands.
