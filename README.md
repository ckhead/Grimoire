# Grimoire
A grimoire is "a book of magic spells and invocations."

I have a bunch of Google Docs where I put code that I use infrequently and tend to forget. 
So now my plan is to convert these files to Markdown and gradually move them up to Grimoire.
- [Shell commands including git](https://github.com/ckhead/Grimoire/blob/main/shell_commands.md)
- [LaTeX packages and tricks](https://github.com/ckhead/Grimoire/blob/main/LaTeX_tricks.md)
- R (mainly data.table)
- Julia
  
So far I have done this for Shell and LaTeX.
